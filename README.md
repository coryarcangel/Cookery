**COOKERY**
Cory Arcangel & Henry Van Dusen

A "deep frying" command-line utility which can randomly generate "deep frying" scores, and playback those scores on an image or on the frames of a video file (with optional key-framing!). 

Requires [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php), realpath, and video support requires [FFMPEG](ffmpeg.org).

required args:
- `-f` image_file (default: spongebob.jpg) 

You can also always add the image file as the last argument without `-f`

optional args:
- `-n` iterations (default: 5)
- `-s` save every (default: 1)
- `-h` generated recipe filename (default: recipe.txt)
- `-r` recipe file to cook with (default: null)
  - must be a recipe file that resulted from cooking
  - `-n` and `-h` arguments will be ignored
- `-o` output_directory (default: autogenerated based on date/time)
- `-l` only generate the last image (default: false. just include -l to turn on)
  - `-n` argument will be ignored

**INSTALLATION:**

Run the installation script to add the `cook` executable to your path:

    sudo ./install.sh

**USAGE:**

    cook -o output_folder spongebob.jpg
  

By default, cooking steps will be saved to a file called recipe.txt. To use a different name, use `-h` [filename]. 

When we run

    cook -h my_recipe.txt -o output_folder -f spongebob.jpg

we should see these files in `output_folder`:

    my_recipe.txt
    spongebob-step-1.jpg
    spongebob-step-2.jpg
    spongebob-step-3.jpg
    spongebob-step-4.jpg
    spongebob-step-5.jpg

Here's `spongebob-step-5.jpg`:

We can reuse `output_folder/my_recipe.txt` on other images! To replay a recipe file, pass the `-r` flag to `cook`: 

    cook -r output_folder/my_recipe.txt -o output_folder -f mr-krabs.jpg

Here's the resulting `mr-krabs-step-5.jpg`, cooked with `my_recipe.txt`:

**COOK A VIDEO**

`cook` works with video!  Here's how to cook a video at 60 frames per second (the default is 30fps), saving all generated files in the `video-output` folder:

    cook -r recipe.txt -fr 60 -o video-output vid.mp4

This script generates individual frames from the video at the specified framerate, saves cooked versions of each frame following the recipe file into a `cooked` subfolder, and recombines those frames back into a video called `out.mp4` in `cooked`. 

**COOKERY DIRECTOR: -d**

Instead of using a single recipe file to cook all frames of a video, you can provide a combination of recipe files and specify which frames they apply to using the Cookery Director flag, `-d`. This points to a director file. 

The director file contains one or more lines containing this format: 

`[starting frame],[required recipe file],[optional recipe file for keyframing]`

For example:

    1,recipe1.txt
    200,recipe2.txt,recipe3.txt
    800,recipe3.txt

This file will apply recipe1.txt to frames 1-199. 
Then from frame 200-799, recipe2.txt will be applied with decreasing strength, while recipe3.txt will be applied with increasing strength. This achieves a keyframe-like effect (!!!!!!!)
Then recipe3.txt will be applied from frame 800 to the final frame. Each recipe file is given as its relative path from the director file.

    cook -d ./director -fr 60 -o video-output vid.mp4

> **_Hot tip:_**  to see how many frames are in a video, use the `-fc` flag:
>
>     cook -fc vid.mp4
>     total frames: 150
> 
> **_Hot tip:_**  generate a ton! 
> 
> for i in {1..10}; do input=spongebob.jpg; output=$(date +"%d-%m-%Y-%H-%M-%S")-$input; mkdir $output;./cook -n 100 -o $output -f $input; done
